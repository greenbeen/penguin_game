Need to _draw_ slope image instead of slope segments
Then need to have position of slope image move left (-) on the x axis
   for every pixel the ball moves forward (+) on the x axis
   

Also need to work out alignment of pymunk slope segments on screen (screen size?)
   and coordinate it with the slope image.
